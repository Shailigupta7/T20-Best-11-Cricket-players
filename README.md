# T20-Best-11-Cricket-players
In this end-to-end data analysis project, we used data from the Cricket T20 World Cup (2022) to gain insight into the teams with the top 11 players. I use web scraping to collect data from the espn cricinfo website, transformed and cleansed the data in Pandas, and then created a dashboard in Power BI.

Project steps:
-

🌐 Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Raw data is collected from the ESPN database and preprocessed in Python. Apply data cleansing and feature engineering techniques to get your data into the desired analytical format.

🧹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Cleansing:

EDA was performed on the preprocessed data using Python. This step involves performing statistical analysis, creating visualizations, and identifying patterns and trends in your data.

🪄Export data to Power BI:

Export the preprocessed data and the results of the EDA and modeling steps to Power BI using the appropriate CSV file format.

⚒️ Create a dashboard:

Created a new report in Power BI and added visualizations such as tables, charts, and graphs that represent the analyzed data. Use Power BI's drag-and-drop interface to create dashboards that effectively communicate insights from your analysis.

📊Publish and share dashboards:

Once the dashboard is complete, publish it to the Power BI service. Users can access reports from the Power BI app or web portal.
